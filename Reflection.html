<head>Reflection on creating a GitHub webpage</head>
<p>Creating an account was easy and I used my UWGB email as instructed for the assignment. Then I created a repository and named it photo essay. I already had all the photos I wanted to use in folder so it was easy to upload them all together. Then I tried upload the html for the page and that’s where I made my first mistake. I renamed the file Photo_Essay_index.html, and another html appeared after I added the file to the repository so the file name was Photo_Essay_index.html.html. Then I changed the name to Photo_Essay_index and uploaded it again.</p>
<p>I followed the directions and published the webpage, but it went to 404 error page. I checked the html in the index file by pasting it into W3Schools “try it” page and there didn’t seem to be any errors, so I tried renaming the file. I had to google “Deleting files in a repository” to figure out that the option to delete is hidden in the top right corner, under the 3 dots. I deleted the Photo_Essay_index file and then I renamed the file “index,” uploaded it again, and refreshed the website. It worked!</p>
<p>I adjusted the size of one of my photos so they would all be the same and then I added a link to the readme file. Now I will upload this file and add a link to it as well. I don’t know if I will remember all of the steps if I were to try to do this again, but I know that I can figure it out because I already did it once.</p>
